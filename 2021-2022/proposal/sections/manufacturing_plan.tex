Our manufacturing flow follows the outline found in \cref{fig:plannedtiming} which includes three design-build-fly phases.  \Cref{fig:manufacturingplan} shows this flow with more clarity.  Note that for all phases, CAD will commence roughly a week after design starts, prototyping a week after that.

\subsubsection{Phase 1} We began with a conceptual design along with conceptual CAD, from which we have built concept prototypes to be used in testing as described below. {\color{BYUred}[ADD A DETAIL ABOUT MATERIALS AND/OR PROCESSES.]}

\subsubsection{Phase 2} We are currently beginning our preliminary design and CAD from which we will build preliminary prototypes for testing. {\color{BYUred}[ADD A DETAIL ABOUT MATERIALS AND/OR PROCESSES.]}

\subsubsection{Phase 3} Around the new year, we will start on our detailed design and CAD, which will lead to our final testing prototypes.  After polishing the design and CAD after final testing, we will manufacture our final competition aircraft. {\color{BYUred}[ADD A DETAIL ABOUT MATERIALS AND/OR PROCESSES.]}
