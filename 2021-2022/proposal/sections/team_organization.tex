%Introduction
\Cref{fig:personnelassignments} depicts the overall organization of our team structure.  Each of the teams is lead by an individual who answers to the Engineering Lead and Project Manager.  The skills required for each position/team are as follows.




%Team role descriptions continued.
\subsubsection{Engineering Lead} As with the team leads, the Engineering Lead primarily requires good decision making and leadership skills, qualities the BYU Aero Club seeks to develop in all of its members.
In addition the Engineering Lead has a well rounded understanding of the various systems and both design and testing expertise.

\end{wrapfigure} The Project Manager has excellent organizational skills
and oversees the logistical side of the project: heading up report writing, budgeting tasks, scheduling, etc.
\subsubsection{Aerodynamics} The Aerodyanmics team members have expertise in aerodynamic analysis and testing, including skills in hand calculations, computational analysis tools, wind tunnel and glide testing.
\subsubsection{Structures} The Structures team members focus on skills in structural analysis and testing, employing hand calculations, computational tools, and various structural testing methods.
\subsubsection{Propulsion} The Propulsion team focuses on analyzing and testing the propulsion system effectiveness and efficiency, but also has skills in electronics related to the propulsion system.
\subsubsection{Systems} The Systems team works very closely with the Engineering Lead, as they oversee all systems interfacing, avionics, etc.  There is a sub-group of the Systems team that is assigned to work on the mission specific payload and related components, as well as related testing. %TODO: consider updating this sentence to reflect the actual specialized mission requirements for the year.
\subsubsection{Manufacturing} The Manufacturing team oversees the manufacturing of all prototypes and testing apparatus.
\subsubsection{Graphics} The Graphics team has skills in CAD design as well as graphical marketing for the team.
