%timeline description.
\Cref{fig:plannedtiming} depicts our planned timeline for the year. \Cref{sec:ManufacturingPlan,sec:TestingPlan} describe the flow of our schedule in more detail. Note that at the time of submitting this proposal, we have completed the conceptual design presented herein and have moved on to our preliminary design phase. Also of note is that we began prototyping early in order to apply a ``fail fast, fail often'' methodology to quickly fill any gaps in understanding and allow our underclassmen to develop their aircraft design intuition faster than if we waited to prototype after completing all the design phases.

%timeline figure included above since it looks better there.
