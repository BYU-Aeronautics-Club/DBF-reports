%budget introduction
\Cref{tab:budget} contains a breakdown of our budget estimates for the \the\year-\NextYear ~competition year. 
%Funding acquisition details
To obtain funding for our team this year, we submitted a grant proposal through the BYU Aeronautics Club to the Weidman Center for Global Leadership, an organization at BYU that provides funding for groups offering significant leadership growth opportunities to students.  Upon receiving the proposed grant, the BYU Department of Mechanical Engineering matched the amount we acquired through the Weidman Center grant.  A portion of these funds is allotted to general club activities and internal competitions, while the portion allotted to our team is itemized in \cref{tab:budget}.  Shipping costs for our aircraft will be \$0, as we anticipate driving to Kansas, rather than flying, therefore we can transport the aircraft ourselves.
